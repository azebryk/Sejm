# Polish Parliament Speeches


The Polish Parliament (Sejm) has 460 members that are elected every four years. During that period they have numerous meetings and debates about most important topics for Poland. However, there are so many hours of debates so it is quite hard to manually looking through all of the things that have been said. That is why I came up with this project.\
I scraped the shorthand reports for each meeting from November 2019 till April 2022, preprocessed it and used NLP techniques to investigate the data, topics and built application that allows to use it.
